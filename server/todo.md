# To Do List

## turn all get requests to POST requests

## send sessionID and userID from client

## by trying JWTs, I might be able to avoid multiple POST requests by providing a method variable with the JWT. It's industry standard.

## my own implementation might not look as good to employers. though php session id is pretty secure, it's not JWT secure

## give it one try

## if it fails, go back to PHPSESSID and maybe save client ip address as well? maybe base64url token too?
